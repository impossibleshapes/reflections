When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This would likely occur when you're not able to work locally.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Manually pulling gives you the option to control when and what changes you want to record.
